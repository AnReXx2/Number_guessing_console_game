## 🎯 Project Overview

Simple yet robust **console-based Number Guessing Game** written in **C++**.  
The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it with hints ("Too high!" / "Too low!").  

Created as a portfolio project to practice and demonstrate:
- Random number generation (`rand()` + `srand()`)
- Input validation & error recovery
- Loop control (`do-while` + `while`)
- Clean, user-friendly console interface

**Main features**
- Random secret number (1–100) generated each round
- Unlimited attempts with attempt counter
- Helpful feedback after each guess
- Full protection against invalid input (letters/symbols won't crash the game)
- Play again option (y/n)
